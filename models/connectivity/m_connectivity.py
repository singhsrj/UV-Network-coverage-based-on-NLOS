m-connectivity probability calculations.
Implements Equations 25-27 from the paper.

Simple explanation:
- m-connectivity: Every node has at least m neighbors
- 1-connected: Basic connectivity (everyone has ≥1 neighbor)
- 2-connected: Robust (everyone has ≥2 neighbors) - if one fails, still connected
- 3-connected: Very robust (everyone has ≥3 neighbors)
