models/network/boolean_coverage.py

Boolean coverage model for UV network.
Implements Equation 2 from the paper.

Simple explanation:
- For any point in space: it's either covered or not covered
- Covered = within range of at least one device
- Not covered = too far from all devices
- Like asking: "Can I get WiFi signal here? Yes or No"
