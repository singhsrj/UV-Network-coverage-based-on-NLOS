# Phase 2 Implementation Complete ✅
## Network Coverage - From Single Nodes to Full Networks

---

## 🎯 What We Built in Phase 2

In simple terms, Phase 2 takes us from "how far does signal travel" (Phase 1) to "how do we cover an entire area with multiple devices."

### The Journey:
1. **Single transmitter** → How much area does ONE side cover?
2. **6-sided device** → What if we have transmitters on all sides?
3. **Multiple devices** → When circles overlap, how much total area is covered?
4. **Network planning** → How many devices do we need and where to place them?

## 📦 Modules Implemented (6 New Files)

### 1. **NLOS Communication Modes** (`nlos_scattering.py`)
**What it does**: Explains the 3 different ways UV light can travel

**Simple explanation**:
- **NLOS-a**: Both vertical (like a lighthouse - covers all directions equally)
- **NLOS-b**: One angled, one vertical (semi-directional)
- **NLOS-c**: Both angled (like a flashlight - best performance, most directional)

**Key functions**:
- `determine_mode()` - Figures out which mode based on angles
- `calculate_scattering_efficiency()` - How well light bounces off air
- `compare_modes()` - Shows which mode is best

**Real-world analogy**: Like choosing between a light bulb (spreads everywhere) vs a flashlight (focused beam)

---

### 2. **Single-Side Coverage** (`single_side_coverage.py`)
**What it does**: Calculates the area covered by ONE transmitter

**Implements**: Equations 3-7 from the paper

**Simple explanation**:
- Light comes out in a cone shape
- When it hits the ground, it makes a specific pattern
- We calculate: triangle area + half an ellipse area
- Total = how much ground is covered

**Key calculations**:
- `calculate_R1()` - How far the coverage reaches (Equation 4)
- `calculate_triangle_area()` - Triangle-shaped part (Equation 5)
- `calculate_ellipse_area()` - Oval-shaped part (Equation 6)
- `calculate_total_coverage()` - Add them up (Equation 7)

**Example**: At 75m distance with 30°-50° angles → covers about 660 m²

---

### 3. **Hexahedral Terminal** (`hexahedral_terminal.py`)
**What it does**: Models a 6-sided device (cube with transmitters on each face)

**Simple explanation**:
- Like a dice with LEDs on all 6 faces
- Can transmit in ALL directions (omnidirectional)
- Each face: 0.5W power, LED array + detector
- Total power: 3W (6 × 0.5W)

**Key features**:
- `calculate_omnidirectional_coverage()` - Total coverage (circular: πl²)
- `estimate_network_nodes()` - How many devices needed for an area
- 6 faces: top, bottom, north, south, east, west

**Real-world analogy**: Like having 6 flashlights pointing in different directions, mounted on a cube

---

### 4. **Boolean Coverage** (`boolean_coverage.py`)
**What it does**: Answers "Is this point covered? Yes or No"

**Implements**: Equation 2 from the paper

**Simple explanation**:
- For any spot on the ground: either covered (1) or not covered (0)
- No partial coverage - binary decision
- Covered = within range of at least one device
- Like asking "Can I get WiFi here?" → Yes/No

**Key functions**:
- `is_point_covered()` - Check if ONE node covers a point
- `is_point_covered_by_network()` - Check if ANY node covers it
- `count_covering_nodes()` - How many nodes cover this point (redundancy)
- `calculate_area_coverage()` - What % of an area is covered

**Example**: Point 49m away from node with 50m range → Covered ✓

---

### 5. **Effective Coverage** (`effective_coverage.py`)
**What it does**: Calculates REAL coverage when circles overlap

**Implements**: Equations 10-17, 28-29 from the paper

**Simple explanation**:
- Multiple devices = overlapping circles
- Don't count overlaps twice!
- Effective coverage = union of circles (total shaded area)
- Only 55.45% of each node's coverage is "new" area

**Key calculations**:
- `calculate_S1()` - Corner gaps (Equation 14)
- `calculate_S2()` - Edge overlaps (Equation 12)
- `calculate_four_node_effective_coverage()` - Standard 4-node network (Equation 15)
- `calculate_single_node_effective_coverage()` - One node's contribution (Equation 17)
- `calculate_minimum_nodes()` - How many needed for area (Equation 29)

**The Magic Number**: **η_eff = 55.45%** (Equation 28)
- This means only 55.45% of each node's coverage is useful
- The rest is overlap with neighbors or gaps
- CRITICAL for network planning!

**Example**: 
- One node covers πl² area
- But only adds 0.5545 × πl² of NEW coverage to network

---

### 6. **Square Deployment** (`square_deployment.py`)
**What it does**: Places nodes in a grid pattern to cover an area

**Simple explanation**:
- Arranges nodes like a checkerboard
- Even spacing for efficient coverage
- Calculates: How many nodes? Where to put them?

**Key deployments**:
- `create_four_node_network()` - Basic 4-node square (Figure 8)
  - Side length = 3 × communication distance
  - Standard test configuration
  
- `create_grid_network()` - Cover rectangular area
  - Automatically calculates grid size
  - Places nodes at regular intervals
  
- `create_minimum_node_network()` - Use Equation 29
  - Finds minimum nodes needed
  - Optimized placement

**Real-world use**:
"Cover 1 km² with 95m range devices" → Need 96 nodes in 10×10 grid

## 🧮 Key Equations Validated

### ✅ Equation 2: Boolean Coverage
```
p(X) = 1 if d(O,X) < R, else 0
```
Simple: Within range? → 1 (covered), Too far? → 0 (not covered)

### ✅ Equation 4: Coverage Radius R₁
```
R₁ = [sin(θ₂) / sin(θ₁ + θ₂)] × l
```
How far the coverage extends based on angles

### ✅ Equation 7: Total Single-Side Coverage
```
S_TB'C'D' = S_triangle + ½ × S_ellipse
```
Triangle area + half ellipse area

### ✅ Equation 15: Four-Node Coverage
```
S_4-eff = 9l² - 4S₁ - 4S₂
```
Square area - corner gaps - edge overlaps

### ✅ Equation 17: Single-Node Effective
```
S_eff = ½πl² + (S₁ - S₂)
```
Effective area added by one node

### ✅ Equation 28: Coverage Efficiency
```
η_eff = S_eff / S_node = 55.45%
```
**THE KEY NUMBER FOR PLANNING!**

### ✅ Equation 29: Minimum Nodes

n_min = S_ROI / S_eff = S_ROI / (η_eff × πl²)
```
How many devices needed to cover an area

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. The 55.45% Rule
**Most Important Finding:**
- Every node covers πl² area
- But only 55.45% is useful (rest is overlap/gaps)
- **Always multiply by 0.5545 when planning networks!**

### 2. Four-Node Standard
- Side length = 3l (not 2l!)
- This spacing balances coverage vs overlap
- Used as reference throughout the paper

### 3. Grid Deployment Works
- Square/grid pattern is efficient
- Easy to calculate and deploy
- Well-understood topology

### 4. Coverage vs Connectivity Trade-off
- More overlap = better connectivity (devices can talk)
- Less overlap = more efficient coverage
- 55.45% is the sweet spot

## 🎯 Real-World Applications

### Example 1: Park Coverage
**Question**: "Cover 100m × 100m park"
- Area: 10,000 m²
- With 95m range devices: Need ~11 nodes
- Arrange in 4×3 grid
- Cost: 11 devices

### Example 2: City District
**Question**: "Cover 1 km × 1 km area"
- Area: 1,000,000 m²
- With 95m range: Need ~96 nodes
- Arrange in 10×10 grid
- Can reduce with higher power

### Example 3: Budget Constraint
**Question**: "Only have 50 devices, what area can we cover?"
- 50 devices × 0.5545 × πl² = max area
- With l=95m: Can cover ~400,000 m²
- That's 632m × 632m area
